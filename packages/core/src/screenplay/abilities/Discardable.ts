/**
 * An interface to be implemented by any [`Ability`](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/Ability/) that needs to free up
 * the resources it uses, e.g. disconnect from a database.
 *
 * This [`Discardable.close`](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/interface/Discardable/#discard) method is invoked directly by the [actor](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/Actor/), and indirectly by the [stage](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/Stage/):
 * - when [SceneFinishes](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/SceneFinishes/), for actors instantiated after [SceneStarts](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/SceneStarts/) - e.g. within a test scenario or in a "before each" hook
 * - when [`TestRunFinishes`](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/TestRunFinishes/), for actors instantiated before [SceneStarts](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/SceneStarts/) - e.g. in a "before all" hook
 *
 * Note that events such as [SceneFinishes](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/SceneFinishes/) and [`TestRunFinishes`](https://serenity-js.org/api/core-events/class/TestRunFinishes/) are emitted by Serenity/JS test runner adapters,
 * such as `@serenity-js/cucumber`, `@serenity-js/mocha`, `@serenity-js/jasmine`, and so on.
 * Consult their respective readmes to learn how to register them with your test runner of choice.
