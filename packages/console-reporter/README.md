## Serenity/JS Console Reporter

[`@serenity-js/console-reporter`](https://serenity-js.org/api/console-reporter/) writes [text-based reports](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/console-reporter)
to your computer terminal.


### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/core @serenity-js/console-reporter
```


#### Windows

If you're on Windows, consider using [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
instead of `cmd.exe` to benefit from the colour output.

### Usage

To allow Serenity/JS to print the progress report to standard output, assign the `ConsoleReporter` to the `Stage`.

This can be done:
- via `playwright.config.ts`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [Playwright Test](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test)
- via `wdio.conf.ts`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [WebdriverIO](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test)
- via `protractor.conf.js`, if you're using Serenity/JS with [Protractor](https://serenity-js.org/api/protractor)
- or programmatically.

#### Usage with Playwright Test

                '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
                
                // console reporter with a theme for 'dark', 'light' or 'mono' terminals
