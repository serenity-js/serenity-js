## Serenity/JS Cucumber

[`@serenity-js/cucumber`](https://serenity-js.org/api/cucumber/) contains a set of adapters you register with [Cucumber CLI runners](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/) to enable integration and reporting between Cucumber.js and Serenity/JS.

**Please note:** To use Cucumber and Serenity/JS to execute web-based acceptance tests, you should register Serenity/JS Cucumber adapter using Protractor configuration file. 

Learn more about integrating Serenity/JS Cucumber:
- with [Protractor and Cucumber.js](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/protractor/),
- with [Cucumber.js](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/).

This module reports test scenarios executed by **any version of Cucumber.js**, from 0.x to 9.x, which you need to install
separately.

To install [Cucumber 9.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cucumber/cucumber), run:
```
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber

cucumber-js --format @serenity-js/cucumber \
    --require ./features/support/setup.js \
    --require ./features/step_definitions/sample.steps.js 
```

```
'--format-options', `{ "specDirectory": "${ path.resolve(__dirname, '../../cucumber-specs/features') }" }`,
```

#### Cucumber 3.x to 6.x

```
cucumber-js --format node_modules/@serenity-js/cucumber \
