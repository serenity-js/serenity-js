# Screenplay Pattern

The **Screenplay Pattern** is an innovative, [user-centred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) approach
to writing high-quality automated acceptance tests.
It steers your team towards effectively using **layers of abstraction**,
helps your test scenarios capture the **business vocabulary** of **your domain**,
and encourages good testing and software engineering habits.

Focusing on actors and their goals and incorporating your domain language into test scenarios
improves **team collaboration** and **alignment**, enabling technical and business stakeholders to understand
and readily contribute to the test automation process.

Serenity/JS implementation of the Screenplay Pattern enables developers to easily introduce this design approach
even into [existing test automation projects](/handbook/getting-started/#modernising-existing-projects).
Moreover, the framework
provides [integration libraries](/handbook/getting-started/architecture/#serenityjs-screenplay-pattern-apis) to
facilitate various test automation types, including end-to-end, component, mobile and API testing,
making it a versatile choice for different testing needs.
Serenity/JS also provides [reporting tools](/handbook/reporting/) and [code reuse patterns](/handbook/design/) that facilitate
sharing test code across projects and teams and reducing maintenance costs.

## The design principle

The design principle behind the Screenplay Pattern is simple but might forever change the way you look at test automation:

:::tip Remember
**Automated acceptance tests** should use **your domain language** to clearly express what **activities** the **actors**
interacting with **your system** need to perform in order to accomplish **their goals**.
:::

Applying this design principle to your automated tests has a number of positive implications:
- Expressing your test scenarios in **your domain language** makes them easier to understand and accessible to a wider audience
- Focusing on **actors** and **their goals** makes it easy to correlate any test failures with the actual business impact
- Modelling actor workflows using sequences of business-focused, reusable **activities** reduces code duplication, improves flexibility of your test code base,
and means that your team can quickly compose new test scenarios from existing steps

> To communicate effectively, the code must be based on the same language used to write the requirements—the same language that the developers speak with each other and with domain experts.
>

## The five elements of the Screenplay Pattern

The **Screenplay Pattern** uses the [system metaphor](https://wiki.c2.com/?SystemMetaphor) of a **stage performance**,
helping you model each test scenario like a little [screenplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay)
describing how the actors should go about performing their activities
while interacting with the [system under test](http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html).

Following the Screenplay Pattern helps you capture:
- **Who** the actors interacting with your system are
- **Why** they interact with your system
- **What** they need to do to accomplish their goals
- **How** exactly they would go about that

The five building blocks of the Screenplay Pattern are:
- **[Actors](#actors)**, who represent **people** and **external systems** interacting with the system under test
- **[Abilities](#abilities)**, that act as **thin wrappers** around any **integration libraries** required to interact with the system under test
- **[Interactions](#interactions)**, which represent the **low-level activities** an actor can perform using a given interface
- **[Tasks](#tasks)**, used to model **sequences of activities** as meaningful steps of a business workflow in your domain
- **[Questions](#questions)**, used to **retrieve information** from the system under test and the test execution environment

## Screenplay Pattern with Serenity/JS

The best way to illustrate the Screenplay Pattern is through a practical example, so assume for a moment that we're writing a test scenario
for an online shop. The shop has a REST API that lets us configure its product catalogue with some test data,
and a web storefront that lets customers find the products they need and make a purchase.

We'll create a test scenario that uses two actors: one to set up the test data, and one to interact with the web UI.

:::tip Serenity/JS Project Templates
To follow along with the coding, get one of the [**Serenity/JS Project Templates**](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) as they come with everything you need to get started with Serenity/JS.
:::

### Actors

A test scenario following the Screenplay Pattern has one or multiple [**actors**](/api/core/class/Actor)
representing people and external systems interacting with the system under test and playing specific roles.

:::tip The role of an actor
Just like the five core elements of the Screenplay Pattern, the term "role" comes from the system metaphor of a **stage performance**.
It should be interpreted as the role a given actor plays in the performance,
the role they play in the system. Some good examples of roles include "a doctor", "a trader", or "a writer".

While a "role" might imply the _permissions_ a given actor has in the system they interact with (e.g. a "writer" can write articles,
but only a "publisher" publishes articles), this is not a mechanism to _prevent_ the actor from performing activities inconsistent with their role.

In particular, Serenity/JS will not prevent you from writing scenarios where a "writer" tries to impersonate a "publisher"
and publish an article. If it did, you would not be able to test if your system correctly implemented its access control mechanisms!
:::

Our example scenario could have two actors, who we'll call:
- Apisitt, responsible for setting up test data using the REST API
- Wendy, representing a customer interacting with the web UI

#### Instantiating and retrieving actors

With Serenity/JS, you can instantiate new actors or retrieve the ones you've already referenced in the given scenario using the function
[`actorCalled`](/api/core/function/actorCalled) and providing the name of the actor:

```ts title="spec/screenplay-pattern.ts"
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

actorCalled('Apisitt')  // returns: Actor(name='Apisitt')
actorCalled('Wendy')    // returns: Actor(name='Wendy')
```

Note that **every Serenity/JS actor is uniquely identified by their name**.
The first time you call `actorCalled('Wendy')`, Serenity/JS instantiates a new [`Actor`](/api/core/class/Actor/)
and stores a reference to it internally under the name you gave it.
This way, whenever you call `actorCalled('Wendy')` **within the same scenario** again, you'll get the same actor instance back.

```ts title="spec/screenplay-pattern.ts"
import assert from 'node:assert/strict'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

const wendy1 = actorCalled('Wendy') // first invocation of actorCalled
const wendy2 = actorCalled('Wendy') // second invocation of actorCalled

assert.equal(wendy1, wendy2)        // wendy1 === wendy 2
```

To avoid typos and repetition when instantiating and retrieving actors in your test scenarios,
you might want to consider using [string enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#string-enums)
or constants to store actor names:

```ts title="spec/screenplay-pattern.ts"
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

enum ActorNames {
    Apisitt = 'Apisitt, the test data manager',
    Wendy   = 'Wendy, the customer',
}

actorCalled(ActorNames.Apisitt)  // returns: Actor(name='Apisitt')
actorCalled(ActorNames.Wendy)    // returns: Actor(name='Wendy')
````

#### Using actors with test runners

While you could use Serenity/JS and the [`actorCalled`](/api/core/function/actorCalled) function as part of any regular Node.js program,
you'll typically use it with a test runner such as [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test),
[Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha), or [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine).

To help you ensure no state leakage between test scenarios, [Serenity/JS test runner adapters](/handbook/test-runners)
will also [automatically dismiss](/api/core/class/Actor/#dismiss) any actors instantiated within the scope of a test scenario and free up the resources
they were using when the scenario finishes.

Note that since different test runners have different APIs, the way you retrieve actors might vary slightly depending on the test runner you use:

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'


describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {
    actorCalled('Apisitt')  // returns: Actor(name="Apisitt")
    actorCalled('Wendy')    // returns: Actor(name="Wendy")
  })
})
```

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Mocha"}
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async () => {
    actorCalled('Apisitt')  // returns: Actor(name="Apisitt")
    actorCalled('Wendy')    // returns: Actor(name="Wendy")
  })
})
```

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Jasmine"}
import 'jasmine'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async () => {
    actorCalled('Apisitt')  // returns: Actor(name="Apisitt")
    actorCalled('Wendy')    // returns: Actor(name="Wendy")
  })
})
```

```ts title="features/step_definitions/online_shop.steps.ts" tab={"label":"Cucumber"}
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

// Given the product catalogue has "Apples" at £2.50
Given('the product catalogue has {string} at £{float}', async (product: string, price: number) => {
    actorCalled('Apisitt') // returns: Actor(name="Apisitt")
    // ...
})
```

### Abilities

Actors have [**abilities**](/api/core/class/Ability) that enable them to interact with the various interfaces
of the system under test and the test execution environment.

From the technical perspective, **abilities** act as **wrappers** around any **integration libraries** required
to communicate with the external interfaces of system under test,
such as [web browser drivers](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/) or an [HTTP client](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi/),
or [hold state](/api/core/class/TakeNotes/) to allow actors to remember retrieved information.
Abilities also enable [portability](/handbook/design/portable-test-code)
of your test code across various lower-level integration libraries as they expose a standardised API.

:::info Did you know?
The word "screen" in "screenplay" has nothing to do with the _computer screen_.
On the contrary, the Screenplay Pattern is a **general method** of modelling acceptance tests interacting with _any_
external interface of your system. In fact, Serenity/JS implementation of the Screenplay Pattern can help you
break free from UI-only-based testing!
:::

To allow Apisitt to interact with a [REST API](/api/rest), we'll give him the ability to [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi),
wrapping an instance of an [Axios HTTP client](https://axios-http.com/docs/instance):

```ts title="spec/screenplay-pattern.ts"
import axios from 'axios'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'

const axiosInstance = axios.create({ baseURL 'https://api.example.org/' })

const actor = actorCalled('Apisitt')
    .whoCan(CallAnApi.using(axiosInstance))

// ...
```

At the same time, to allow Wendy to interact with the [web UI](/api/web) we'll give her an instance of a [Playwright browser](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser), although she could use any other [popular web browser driver supported by Serenity/JS](/handbook/web-testing/):

```ts title="spec/screenplay-pattern.ts"
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'

import { chromium } from 'playwright'

async function example() {
    let browser

    try {
        browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false })

        const actor = actorCalled('Wendy')
            .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser))

        // ...
    }
    finally {
        if (browser) {
            await browser.close()
        }
    }
}
```

Even though the [`actorCalled`](/api/core/function/actorCalled) function makes instantiating and retrieving actors straightforward, setting up browser drivers, HTTP clients, and similar libraries can be more involved.
Thankfully, Serenity/JS has a mechanism to help you with that, as you'll see in the next section.

#### Using default test runner configuration

Since configuring integration libraries like Axios or Playwright is a common task in test automation,
Serenity/JS test runner adapters use your test runner's configuration to set up the abilities for you.
And so, Serenity/JS adapters for the following test runners will automatically give every actor you retrieve via [`actorCalled`](/api/core/function/actorCalled) the below abilities so that you don't have to configure them yourself:
- [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test):
    - [`BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright`](/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/),
    - [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi) at [`baseURL`](/api/playwright/interface/PlaywrightOptions/#baseURL) configured in the [Playwright Test config file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration),
    - [`TakeNotes`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes)
- [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) (with [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine), or [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha)):
    - [`BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO`](/api/webdriverio/class/BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO/),
    - [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi) at [`baseUrl`](/api/webdriverio/interface/WebdriverIOConfig/#baseUrl) configured in the [WebdriverIO config file](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/),
    - [`TakeNotes`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes)
- [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor/) (with [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine), or [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha)):
    - [`BrowseTheWebWithProtractor`](/api/protractor/class/BrowseTheWebWithProtractor/),
    - [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi) at [`baseUrl`](/api/protractor-adapter/interface/Config/#baseUrl) configured in the [Protractor config file](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/config.ts),
    - [`TakeNotes`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes)

To retrieve actor's ability to do something, you can use the [`Actor.abilityTo`](/api/core/class/Actor/#whoCan) method,
which returns an implementation of the ability if the actor has it, or throws a [`ConfigurationError`](/api/core/class/ConfigurationError/) if they don't.
While you wouldn't retrieve the abilities directly in your test scenarios, you'd use this mechanism in your custom [interactions](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#interactions) and [questions](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#questions).

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { BrowseTheWeb } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { TakeNotes } from '@serenity-js/core'
import assert from 'node:assert/strict'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(BrowseTheWeb))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(CallAnApi))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(TakeNotes))

    // ...
  })
})
```

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO with Mocha"}
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'
import { BrowseTheWeb } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { actorCalled, TakeNotes } from '@serenity-js/core'
import assert from 'node:assert/strict'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async () => {
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(BrowseTheWeb))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(CallAnApi))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(TakeNotes))

    // ...
  })
})
```

```ts title="features/step_definitions/online_shop.steps.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO with Cucumber"}
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { BrowseTheWeb } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { actorCalled, TakeNotes } from '@serenity-js/core'
import assert from 'node:assert/strict'

// Given the product catalogue has "Apples" at £2.50
Given('the product catalogue has {string} at £{float}', async (product: string, price: number) => {
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(BrowseTheWeb))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(CallAnApi))
    assert.ok(actorCalled('Wendy').abilityTo(TakeNotes))
    // ...
})
```

:::tip Portable test code
Playwright Test, WebdriverIO and Protractor test runners vary dramatically and have completely different and incompatible APIs.
This would normally tie your test suite to a specific integration tool and prevent you from being able to run test scenarios written for one test runner using another.

To solve this problem and allow your test suite to be agnostic of the underlying integration tool,
Serenity/JS test runner adapters configure the default cast of actors with an ability to [`BrowseTheWeb`](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/)
specific to the given test runner, so: [`BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright`](/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/),
[`BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO`](/api/webdriverio/class/BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO/), or [`BrowseTheWebWithProtractor`](/api/protractor/class/BrowseTheWebWithProtractor/),
but exposing a consistent  API across all test runners.

This design allows you to write test scenarios that interact with the web UI without having to worry about the underlying integration tool and makes your test code [portable across different test runners](/handbook/design/portable-test-code/).
:::

#### Using a custom cast of actors

Following the system metaphor of a stage performance, Serenity/JS uses a [cast of actors](/api/core/class/Cast) to configure the default abilities the actors receive upon instantiation.

If you'd like to modify those defaults, or if you use Serenity/JS with [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine), or [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha) without a [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) or [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor/) wrapper
that set up the defaults automatically, you can instruct Serenity/JS to use a custom cast.


```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'
import { describe, it, test } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { Cast, TakeNotes, Notepad } from '@serenity-js/core'

test.use({
    // Replace the entire default cast:
    actors: async ({ contextOptions, page }, use): Promise<void> => {
        const cast = Cast.where(actor => actor.whoCan(
            BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.usingPage(page, contextOptions),
            TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad(),
            // ... other abilities
        ))

        await use(cast)
    },

    // Alternatively, wrap actorCalled to give actors additional abilities
    // or override the default ones:
    actorCalled: async ({ actorCalled }, use) => {
        await use((name: string) => {
            return actorCalled(name).whoCan(
                TakeNotes.using(Notepad.with({
                  firstName: name,
                  lastName: 'Tester',
                }))
                // ... other abilities
            )
        })
    },
})

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {
    actorCalled('Apisitt')  // returns: Actor(name="Apisitt")
    actorCalled('Wendy')    // returns: Actor(name="Wendy")
  })
})
```

```ts title="wdio.conf.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO"}
import { BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO, WebdriverIOConfig } from '@serenity-js/webdriverio'
import { Cast, TakeNotes } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { browser } from '@wdio/globals'

export const config: WebdriverIOConfig = {

    framework: '@serenity-js/webdriverio',

    serenity: {
        // Replace the entire default cast:
        actors: Cast.where(actor => actor.whoCan(
            BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO.using(browser),
            TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad(),
            // ... other abilities
        )),

        // Configure Serenity/JS to use an appropriate test runner adapter
        runner: 'cucumber', // or: 'mocha', 'jasmine'

        // ... other Serenity/JS configuration
    },
}
```

```ts title="protractor.conf.js" tab={"label":"Protractor"}
const { BrowseTheWebWithProtractor } = require('@serenity-js/protractor')
const { Cast, TakeNotes } = require( '@serenity-js/core')
const protractor = require('protractor')

exports.config = {

    framework:      'custom',
    frameworkPath:  require.resolve('@serenity-js/protractor/adapter'),

    serenity: {

        actors: Cast.where(actor => actor.whoCan(
            BrowseTheWebWithProtractor.using(protractor.browser),
            TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad(),
            // ... other abilities
        )),

        // Configure Serenity/JS to use an appropriate test runner adapter
        runner: 'jasmine', // or 'mocha', 'cucumber'

        // ... other Serenity/JS configuration
    },
}
```

If you're using [Cucumber](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine), or [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha) without a [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) or [Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor/) wrapper,
you can configure the default cast of actors using the [`configure`](/api/core/function/configure/) and [`engage`](/api/core/function/engage/) functions, as per the test runner adapter configuration.

- [Abilities](/api/core/class/Ability)
- [Web testing](/handbook/web-testing/)
- [Api testing](/handbook/api-testing/)
- [Mobile testing](/handbook/mobile-testing/)

### Interactions

Abilities enable actors to perform [**interactions**](/api/core/class/Interaction) with the system under test.
**Interactions** are **command objects** that instruct an actor how to use their abilities to perform the given activity.
Most interactions you will need are already provided by [Serenity/JS modules](/handbook/about/architecture),
and you can easily [create new ones](/api/core/class/Interaction) if you'd like to.

To instruct an actor to attempt to perform a sequence of interactions, use the [`Actor.attemptsTo`](/api/core/class/Actor#attemptsTo) method.
Note that this method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the actor has completed the interactions, or rejects if any of the interactions fail,
so you can use it with `await` in an `async` function.

Here, we instruct Apisitt to use the interaction to [`Send.a(HTTPRequest)`](/api/rest/class/Send) from the [Serenity/JS REST](/api/rest) module
to set up some test data for our test scenario:

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { Send, PostRequest } from '@serenity-js/rest'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(       // - actors attempt to perform interactions
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([  // - interactions like `Send` are command objects,
            { name: 'Apples', price: '£2.50' }     //   that instruct actors how to use their abilities
        ])),
    )

    // ...
  })
})
```

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO with Mocha"}
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Send, PostRequest } from '@serenity-js/rest'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async () => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(       // - actors attempt to perform interactions
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([  // - interactions like `Send` are command objects,
            { name: 'Apples', price: '£2.50' }     //   that instruct actors how to use their abilities
        ])),
    )

    // ...
  })
})
```

```ts title="features/step_definitions/online_shop.steps.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO with Cucumber"}
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Send, PostRequest } from '@serenity-js/rest'

// Given the product catalogue has "Apples" at £2.50
Given('the product catalogue has {string} at £{float}', async (product: string, price: number) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(       // - actors attempt to perform interactions
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([  // - interactions like `Send` are command objects,
            { name: product, price: `£${price}` }  //   that instruct actors how to use their abilities
        ])),
    )
})
```

In the same manner, we can instruct Wendy to use interactions from the [Serenity/JS Web](/api/web) module
to [navigate](/api/web/class/Navigate) to the web interface of our system under test:

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { Send, PostRequest } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Navigate } from '@serenity-js/web'

describe('Online shop', () => {

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(       // - actors attempt to perform interactions
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([  // - interactions like `Send` are command objects,
            { name: 'Apples', price: '£2.50' }     //   that instruct actors how to use their abilities
        ])),
    )

    await actorCalled('Wendy').attemptsTo(
        Navigate.to('https://example.org'),        // - all Serenity/JS interactions have a consistent API,
    )                                              //   no matter the interface they're interacting with
  })
})
```

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"WebdriverIO with Mocha"}

import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Send, PostRequest } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Navigate } from '@serenity-js/web'

// Given the product catalogue has "Apples" at £2.50
Given('the product catalogue has {string} at £{float}', async (product: string, price: number) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(       // - actors attempt to perform interactions
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([  // - interactions like `Send` are command objects,

})
```

Note how the interaction to [`Navigate.to(url)`](/api/web/class/Navigate) comes from the [`@serenity-js/web`](/api/web) module
and works regardless of the underlying web browser driver used by the actor, making your test code [portable across different web integration tools](/handbook/design/portable-test-code/).
Under the hood, the interaction requests the actor's ability to [`BrowseTheWeb`](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/) and Serenity/JS returns the appropriate implementation of the ability.

If you wanted to implement an interaction to `navigateTo(url)` yourself, you might do it like this:

```ts
import { Interaction } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { BrowseTheWeb } from '@serenity-js/web'

const navigateTo = (url: string) =>
    Interaction.where(`#actor navigates to ${ url }`, async actor => {
        const page = await BrowseTheWeb.as(actor).currentPage()

        return page.navigateTo(url)
    })
```

Another thing to note about the code samples in this section is that even though Playwright Test, Mocha, and Cucumber have completely different APIs,
the way we instruct actors to perform interactions is consistent across all test runners. This design makes it easier for you to migrate your test scenarios
from one test runner to another if needed. It also enables you to make your test suite use **different test runners** for **different types of test scenarios** while **reusing the same underlying test automation code**.

For example, you might want to use Serenity/JS with Cucumber for business-facing scenarios, Playwright Test for UI component tests, and with Mocha for REST API tests.

### Questions

Apart from enabling interactions, abilities also enable actors to answer [**questions**](/api/core/class/Question)
about the state of the system under test and the test execution environment.
More specifically, **questions** instruct actors how to use their abilities to **retrieve information when the activity is performed** and provide a way to **parameterise activities**.

When Apisitt uses his ability to [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi) to [`Send`](/api/rest/class/Send) a [`PostRequest`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi),
the result of this interaction is stored in the ability. To retrieve its value, we instruct the actor to answer a question about the [`LastResponse`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse), such as [`LastResponse.status()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse#status).
This declarative approach to information retrieval not only makes your test scenarios more readable, it provides a consistent API for you to design [assertions](/handbook/design/assertions), [waiting and synchronisation statements](/handbook/design/waiting-and-synchronisation/),
and perform [data transformations](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/#transforming-answers-to-questions).

For example, to instruct Apisitt to assert on the result of the HTTP request, we provide him with an interaction to [`Ensure.that`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure),
parameterised with a question about the [`LastResponse.status()`](/api/rest/class/LastResponse#status) and an expectation that the status code [equals](/api/assertions/function/equals/) `201`:

```ts title="spec/online_shop.spec.ts" tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Send, PostRequest, LastResponse } from '@serenity-js/rest'

  it('should allow customers to find products of interest', async ({ actorCalled }) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([
            { name: 'Apples', price: '£2.50' }
        ])),
        Ensure.that(
            LastResponse.status(),
            equals(201)
        )
    )

    // ...
  })
})
```

        ])),
        Ensure.that(
            LastResponse.status(),
            equals(201)
        )
    )

    // ...
  })
})
```

// Given the product catalogue has "Apples" at £2.50
Given('the product catalogue has {string} at £{float}', async (product: string, price: number) => {

    await actorCalled('Apisitt').attemptsTo(
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with([
            { name: product, price: `£${price}` }
        ])),
        Ensure.that(
            LastResponse.status(),
            equals(201)
        )
    )
})

// ...
```

An excellent proof of the **design consistency** enabled by the Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern is that
even though Wendy uses a web browser and not an API client, the way we instruct her to answer [web questions](/handbook/web-testing/)
and [perform web assertions](/handbook/design/assertions#web-assertions) is identical with how you'd interact with any other interface:

### Tasks

The idea that underpins the Screenplay Pattern is to **capture your domain language** and use your acceptance tests as an opportunity to demonstrate
how actors interacting with your system accomplish their goals.

Conceptually similar to standard JavaScript functions, [**tasks**](/api/core/class/Task) offer an easy way to **associate business meaning** with **sequences of activities**
and turn them into **reusable building blocks** from which your team can assemble test scenarios.

For example, we can use Serenity/JS convenient [`Task.where`](/api/core/class/Task/#where) method to define custom tasks that capture how an actor would set up a product catalogue or open an online store:

```ts title="spec/tasks.ts"
import { Task } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Send, PostRequest, LastResponse } from '@serenity-js/rest'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, equals, endsWith } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

export interface Product {
    name:  string;
    price: string;
}

export const setupProductCatalogue = (products: Product[]) =>
    Task.where(`#actor sets up the product catalogue`,
        Send.a(PostRequest.to('/products').with(products)),
        Ensure.that(
            LastResponse.status(),
            equals(201)
        )
    )

export const openOnlineStore = () =>
    Task.where(`#actor opens the online store`,
        Navigate.to('https://example.org'),
        Ensure.that(
            Page.current().title(),
            endsWith('My Example Shop'),
        )
    )
```

As you can see, custom tasks like these are easy to read and understand, and can be parameterised and reused across different test scenarios, test suites, or even across different projects and teams.
Tasks can help you capture the domain language, provide a consistent way to structure your test scenarios, and make your test code reusable and easier to maintain.

            { name: 'Apples', price: '£2.50' }
        ])
    )

    await actorCalled('Wendy').attemptsTo(
        openOnlineStore(),
        // ... other tasks, like findProductCalled('Apples'),
    )
  })
})

## Performing activities at multiple levels

The role of an actor is to perform [activities](/api/core/class/Activity) that demonstrate how to accomplish a given goal.

:::tip Remember
**Actors** represent **people** and **external systems** interacting with the system under test.
:::

For example, we might have an acceptance test that demonstrates how the system under test enables an actor to accomplish the goal of booking a plane
ticket.
If we were using Serenity/JS with a spec-style test runner like [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine), [Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha), or [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test),
we could implement such scenario like this:

```typescript tab={"label":"Playwright Test"}
import { describe, it, test } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

test.use({ defaultActorName: 'Trevor' })

describe('Serenity Airlines flight booking', () => {                            // system feature

  it('should allow travellers to book a plane ticket', async ({ actor }) => {   // scenario goal
    await actor.attemptsTo(
      findFlight('London', 'New York'),                                         // activities
      chooseFlightClass(FlightClass.Economy),
      providePaymentDetails(defaultCard),
      receiveBookingConfirmation(),
    )
  })
})
```

```typescript tab={"label":"Mocha"}
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { describe, it } from 'mocha'

describe('Serenity Airlines flight booking', () => {                            // system feature

  it('should allow travellers to book a plane ticket', () => {                  // scenario goal
    await actorCalled('Trevor').attemptsTo(
      findFlight('London', 'New York'),                                         // activities
      chooseFlightClass(FlightClass.Economy),
      providePaymentDetails(defaultCard),
      receiveBookingConfirmation(),
    )
  })
})
```

```typescript tab={"label":"Jasmine"}
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

describe('Serenity Airlines flight booking', () => {                            // system feature

  it('should allow travellers to book a plane ticket', () => {                  // scenario goal
    await actorCalled('Trevor').attemptsTo(
      findFlight('London', 'New York'),                                         // activities
      chooseFlightClass(FlightClass.Economy),
      providePaymentDetails(defaultCard),
      receiveBookingConfirmation(),
    )
  })
})
```

If we were using [Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber), the name of the feature, the goal of the scenario,
as well as the high-level steps necessary to achieve the goal would already be captured in our [`.feature`](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) files:

```gherkin
Feature: Serenity Airlines flight booking                                       # system feature

  Scenario: traveller books a plane ticket                                      # scenario goal

    Given Trevor finds a flight from 'London' to 'New York'                     # high-level steps
      And he chooses the 'Economy' flight class
     When he provides his payment details
     Then he should receive a booking confirmation
```

In this case, each Cucumber [step definition](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions/?lang=javascript) is mapped
to a Serenity/JS actor performing one or more activities.
Completing those activities helps the actor accomplish the mini-goal of the associated Cucumber step:

```typescript
import { Given } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { Actor } from '@serenity-js/core'

Given('{actor} finds a flight from {string} to {string}',                       // step goal
  async (actor: Actor, origin: string, destination: string) => {
    await actor.attemptsTo(
      findFlight(origin, destination),                                          // activities
    )
  }
)

Given(`{pronoun} chooses the '{flightClass}' flight class`,                     // step goal
  async (actor: Actor, flightClass: FlightClass) => {
    await actor.attemptsTo(
      chooseFlightClass(flightClass),                                           // activities
    )
  }
)
```

From the implementation perspective, functions like `findFlight` or `providePaymentDetails` produce [activities](/api/core/class/Activity),
which are [command objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) that encapsulate information needed for the actor to perform some defined action.

The way you instruct an actor to perform some activities is always exactly the same, no matter the kind of test you write
or the type of interface the actor interacts with - you pass them to the [`Actor.attemptsTo`](/api/core/class/Actor#attemptsTo) method.
This method call makes the actor attempt to perform the activities one by one and returns a standard JavaScript [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
that's resolved when the process is finished, or rejected in case of any errors:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'

await actorCalled('Alice').attemptsTo(
    activity1,
    activity2,
    activity3,
    // ...
)
// returns: Promise<void>
```

Looking at activities from the _design philosophy perspective_, however, can be much more interesting.

The role of an actor is not _just_ to perform _any_ activities. It is to perform activities that demonstrate how a goal can be accomplished at the given **level of abstraction**.
The interesting bit is that the way we describe what the goal is and the vocabulary we use to describe what activities it requires vary depending on the level of abstraction we're operating at.

:::tip Remember
**Actors** demonstrate how to accomplish a **goal** by performing **activities** at multiple **levels of abstraction**.
:::

At the **high levels of abstraction**, e.g. in business-focused acceptance test scenarios,
the vocabulary we use is rooted in the **business domain**, and so are the names we choose for the activities.

For example, an acceptance test scenario might state that for the system to enable the actor to accomplish the **goal** of _booking a plane ticket_,
an actor should be able to successfully perform the following **high-level activities**:
- find an appropriate flight connection,
- choose flight class,
- provide payment details,
- receive booking confirmation.

The names we give functions that produce those activities, such as `findFlight` or `chooseFlightClass`,
represent those steps in the business process and are agnostic of the interface through which actors interact with the system under test.

:::info Model the expected process, not the existing implementation
When describing an acceptance test at a high level of abstraction,
the way we **name the activities** is focused on representing the steps of the **expected business process**
and **not tied to the implementation** of any specific interface of the system under test.
"Find an appropriate flight connection", "choose flight class", or "provide payment details"
are all good examples of such high-level activity names.

This design approach helps to produce test scenarios that are **easier to read and understand** and to a much **wider audience** than the traditional test scripts.
It also results in two other major advantages:
- once the business process is clearly described in our test scenario, we can often use our acceptance tests to identify **obstacles in user journeys**, or even **highlight errors** and **hidden assumptions** in the **business process** itself
- since we're not tying the implementation to any particular interface, we leave ourselves **more integration options** when it comes to automation.

After all, most business process stepscould be accomplished in different ways.
An actor could `findFlight` by interacting with a web UI, a mobile app, by sending requests to a web service, or even by actually going to the ticket office at the airport!
:::

At the **low level of abstraction**, e.g. in UI component tests, the vocabulary we use to describe actor's activities
is focused on the **interface** the actor needs to interact with.
Here the goal might be to _use the web UI to specify the origin airport_. To accomplish it, the actor would need to:
- click on the `origin airport` widget
- enter the name of the origin city, like `London`
- pick the first suggested airport from the list

:::tip Remember
The core idea behind the Screenplay Pattern is to express the acceptance tests from the perspective of **actors**
playing a certain **role** and attempting to accomplish their **goals** by performing **activities** at **multiple levels** of abstraction.
:::

Of course, most activities fall **somewhere in between** the high and low levels of abstraction.
Furthermore, turns out that **higher-level** activities can be **composed of lower-level activities**,
which themselves could be composed of _**even lower-level activities**_!

If you're familiar with [User Experience Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design),
you might recognise this style of [functional decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_decomposition)
from [Hierarchical Task Analysis](https://janmolak.com/user-centred-design-how-a-50-year-old-technique-became-the-key-to-scalable-test-automation-66a658a36555).

The fascinating aspect of looking at your test scenarios as sequences of activities made up of activities,
made up of activities, is that this mental model lends itself perfectly to [functional composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science))
and making _activities_ the primary component of code reuse in Serenity/JS.

## Start with Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern 🚀

The easiest way to **experience** working with Serenity/JS and the Screenplay Pattern is
to **follow the tutorial** and write [**your first web scenario**](/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario)!

When you're ready to **start your own test automation project**, use one of the available [**Serenity/JS Project Templates**](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/)
as they include a handful of Screenplay scenarios and combine some of the most popular configurations of Serenity/JS modules and test automation tools:

- [REST API testing with Cucumber and Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-template)
- [REST API testing with Mocha and Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-template)
- [Web testing with Cucumber, Playwright, and Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template)
- [Web testing with Playwright Test and Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples/playwright-test-todomvc)
- [Web testing with WebdriverIO, Mocha, and Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples/webdriverio-mocha-todomvc)

## History of the Screenplay Pattern

[Serenity/JS](https://github.com/serenity-js) introduced the Screenplay Pattern to JavaScript back in 2016,
but the ideas behind the pattern have been around since 2007 in various forms.

This list is a chronological order of significant events, implementations, and writings related to the evolution of the Screenplay Pattern.
