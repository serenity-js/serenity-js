# Using Serenity/JS with Protractor

```mdx-code-block
import CurrentNodeVersion from '@site/src/components/CurrentNodeVersion'
```

Serenity/JS offers excellent support for **Protractor**!
Plus, it accommodates both classic Protractor tests and Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern scenarios](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/),
allowing you to migrate to Screenplay gradually,
and then simply switch to using Serenity/JS with a more modern web integration tool
like [Playwright](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-playwright-test/) or
[WebdriverIO](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-webdriverio/).

:::tip Use Serenity/JS to migrate away from Protractor
As Protractor [reaches its end of life](https://www.protractortest.org/#/project-status),
you can use Serenity/JS as an abstraction layer that allows you to gradually migrate your tests
to follow the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/),
and then swap out Protractor for a more modern integration tool.
All this while keeping your test suites working all the time!

Check out the [Protractor migration guide](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-protractor/#migrating-from-protractor-to-serenityjs) below 👇👇👇

In this article, and in **less than 5 minutes**, you'll learn how to:
- **integrate Serenity/JS** with your Protractor test suite,
- **enable Serenity BDD reports**,
- start using the **Screenplay Pattern**,
- replace Protractor with **Playwright** or **WebdriverIO** while keeping your tests working!

## About Serenity/JS

[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) is an open-source framework designed to make acceptance and regression testing of complex software systems faster, more collaborative, and easier to scale.

For Protractor test suites, Serenity/JS offers:
- [Enhanced Reporting](/handbook/reporting/) - You can use Serenity/JS
  as a drop-in replacement of any built-in Protractor framework to produce in-depth test execution reports and living documentation of your project.
- [Screenplay Pattern APIs](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/) - To make your test code portable and reusable across projects and teams,
  Serenity/JS gives you an optional [abstraction layer](/api/protractor) on top of native Protractor APIs.
- [Integration Libraries](/api/core/) - For test suites that follow the Screenplay Pattern,
  Serenity/JS also provides optional integration libraries to help you write [API tests](/api/rest/),
  [manage local servers](/api/local-server/), [perform assertions](/api/assertions/), and more!

## Producing Serenity BDD reports and living documentation

[Serenity BDD reports and living documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports) are generated by [Serenity BDD CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/tree/main/serenity-cli),
a Java program downloaded and managed by the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd/) module.

To produce Serenity BDD reports, your test suite must:
- download the Serenity BDD CLI, by calling `serenity-bdd update` which caches the CLI `jar` locally
- produce intermediate Serenity BDD `.json` reports, by registering [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter/) as per the [configuration instructions](#configuring-serenityjs)
- invoke the Serenity BDD CLI when you want to produce the report, by calling `serenity-bdd run`

The pattern used by all the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started#serenityjs-project-templates) relies
on using:
- a [`postinstall`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-operation-order) NPM script to download the Serenity BDD CLI
- [`npm-failsafe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-failsafe) to run the reporting process even if the test suite itself has failed (which is precisely when you need test reports the most...).
- [`rimraf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) as a convenience method to remove any test reports left over from the previous run

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "serenity-bdd update",
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
    "test:execute": "protractor ./protractor.conf.js",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
  }
}
```

To learn more about the `SerenityBDDReporter`, please consult:
- installation instructions in [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` documentation](/api/serenity-bdd/),
- configuration examples in [`SerenityBDDReporter` API docs](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter/),
- [Serenity/JS examples on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples).

## Using Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern APIs

The [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/) is an innovative, user-centred approach to writing high-quality automated acceptance tests. It steers you towards an effective use of layers of abstraction,
helps your test scenarios capture the business vernacular of your domain, and encourages good testing and software engineering habits on your team.

By default, when you register `@serenity-js/protractor` as your Protractor `framework`,
Serenity/JS configures a default [cast](/api/core/class/Cast/) of [actors](/api/core/class/Actor/),
where every actor can:
- [`BrowseTheWebWithProtractor`](/api/protractor/class/BrowseTheWebWithProtractor/)
- [`TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad()`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes/)

This should be enough to help you get started with introducing test scenarios that follow the Screenplay Pattern even to an existing test suite, for example:

```typescript title="specs/example.spec.ts"
import 'jasmine'
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

describe('My awesome website', () => {
    it('can have test scenarios that follow the Screenplay Pattern', async () => {
        await actorCalled('Alice').attemptsTo(
            Navigate.to(`https://www.protractortest.org/`),
            Ensure.that(
                Page.current().title(),
                equals(`Protractor - end-to-end testing for AngularJS`)
            ),
        )
    })

    it('can have non-Screenplay scenarios too', async () => {
        await browser.get(`https://www.protractortest.org`)
        await expect(browser.getTitle())
            .toBe('Protractor - end-to-end testing for AngularJS')
    })
})
```

## Migrating from Protractor to Serenity/JS

Serenity/JS accommodates both classic Protractor tests and Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern scenarios](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/),
allowing you to migrate to Screenplay gradually while **keeping your existing test suites working** and providing value to your organisation
during the migration. With Serenity/JS, there's **no need for a big-bang rewrite**!

If you have an existing Protractor test suite and want to upgrade to a more modern web integration tool like Playwright or WebdriverIO, you'll need to:
- Upgrade your Node.js to the latest [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) version, such as <strong><CurrentNodeVersion /></strong>
- Install [Serenity/JS dependencies](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-protractor/#installing-serenityjs) for Protractor,
as well as [Java Runtime Environment](/handbook/getting-started/installation/#installing-java-runtime-environment-jre) if you'd like to use
[Serenity BDD](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/) reports
- Migrate your existing Protractor tests to use [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern web APIs](/api/web/), which you can do gradually while keeping the remaining scenarios working
- When all your test scenarios are using [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern web APIs](/api/web/) and there are no Protractor API calls left,
introduce [Playwright](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-playwright-test/) or [WebdriverIO](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-webdriverio/) to ensure
your migrated scenarios work with the new integration library
- Remove Protractor dependencies and enjoy your modernised test suite!

:::tip Migrate or rewrite?
Migrating existing Protractor test scenarios to follow the Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern can be a big undertaking, depending on the size, complexity, and stability of your current test suite.
Not to mention that every team has a slightly different Protractor setup and uses the tool in different ways, which makes automating the migration process
challenging.

When migrating to Serenity/JS, start with the easy scenarios so that you can focus the first steps of your migration on making sure your
[continuous integration](/handbook/integration/) and [reporting infrastructure](/handbook/reporting/) work reliably.
This way you'll build a stable foundation upon which you can migrate the more complex tests.

Remember, if your current Protractor test suite is reasonably stable, still works and provides value, there's no need for a risky big bang rewrite
as you can migrate it one scenario at a time while keeping the existing tests working.
However, if your current Protractor test suite _doesn't work_ and you'd rather delete it than migrate it, you might prefer to start from scratch and use Serenity/JS with [Playwright](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-playwright-test/) or [WebdriverIO](/handbook/getting-started/serenity-js-with-webdriverio/) straight away.
The choice is yours and Serenity/JS will support you either way.
:::

### Locating elements

To identify web elements with Serenity/JS you use the [Page Element Query Language](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/).

In short:
- [`PageElement`](/api/web/class/PageElement/) represents a single HTML element,
- [`PageElements`](/api/web/class/PageElements/) represent a collection of HTML elements and lets you filter it based on your criteria.
- [`By`](/api/web/class/PageElements/) represents portable locators used to identify the elements,

For example, to identify an element `<h1 id="title">My article</h1>` in plain Protractor you'd say:
```typescript
element(by.css('h1.title'))
```
Serenity/JS has a similar construct and allows you to specify a description to be used when reporting interactions
with the element:
```typescript
import { By, PageElement } from '@serenity-js/web'

PageElement.located(By.css('h1.title'))
```
However, Serenity/JS also allows you to specify a human-readable description to be used when reporting interactions
with the element:

```typescript
import { By, PageElement } from '@serenity-js/web'

PageElement.located(By.css('h1.title'))
    .describedAs('article title')
```

The below table shows how you can translate common Protractor [element finder expressions](https://www.protractortest.org/#/locators#locators)
to Serenity/JS page element expressions:

| Protractor                                           | Serenity/JS                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `element(by.css('.selector'))`                       | `PageElement.located(By.css('...'))`                                                                                                                                                     |
| `element(by.id('...'))`                              | `PageElement.located(By.id('...'))`                                                                                                                                                      |
| `element(by.xpath('...'))`                           | `PageElement.located(By.xpath('...'))`                                                                                                                                                   |
| `element(by.model('...'))`                           | `PageElement.located(By.css('[ng-model="..."]'))`                                                                                                                                        |
| `element(by.repeater('...'))`                        | `PageElement.located(By.css('[ng-repeat="..."]'))`                                                                                                                                       |
| `element(by.cssContainingText('.selector', 'text'))` | `PageElement.located(By.cssContainingText('.selector', 'text'))`<br />or for greater flexibility:<br />`PageElements.located(By.css('.selector')).where(Text, includes('text')).first()` |
| `element(by.buttonText('Submit'))`                   | `PageElements.located(By.css('button')).where(Text, equals('Submit')).first()`                                                                                                           |
| `element.all`                                        | `PageElements.located(By.css('...'))`                                                                                                                                                    |

Note how with Serenity/JS you can easily express complex queries using intuitive syntax.
For example, you can locate the [last](/api/web/class/PageElements/#last) `<button />` which text meets some [expectation](/api/core/class/Expectation/):

```typescript
import { By, PageElements, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

PageElements.located(By.css('button'))
    .where(Text, equals('Submit'))
    .last()
```

You can create aliases for expressions you use frequently:

```typescript
import { By, PageElements, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

const approveButton = () =>
    PageElements.located(By.css('button'))
        .where(Text, equals('Approve'))
        .first()
```

And you can also [compose page elements](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/#composing-page-elements-using-meta-questions), making them reusable:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Expectation } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { By, Click, PageElement, PageElements } from '@serenity-js/web'

const clientNameField = () =>
    PageElement.located(By.css('[data-test-id="client-name"]'))
        .describedAs('client name field')

const invoiceRecordForClientWhereName = (expectation: Expectation<string>) =>
    PageElements.located(By.css('li.invoice'))
        .where(Text.of(clientNameField()), expectation)
        .first()

await actorCalled('Alice').attemptsTo(
    Click.on(
        approveButton().of(invoiceRecordForClientWhereName(equals('Acme')))
    )
)
```

### Retrieving information

To retrieve information about the current web page, use [`Page.current()`](/api/web/class/Page/).

| Protractor                | Serenity/JS                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `browser.getCurrentUrl()` | `Page.current().url().href` |
| `browser.getTitle()`      | `Page.current().title()`    |

For example, to navigate to a page and then assert on its [title](/api/web/class/Page/#title) and [URL](/api/web/class/Page/#url) you can say:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Ensure, endsWith, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'

await actorCalled('Amanda').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    Ensure.that(
        Page.current().title(),
        endsWith('Serenity/JS')
    ),
    Ensure.that(
        Page.current().url().href,
        equals('https://serenity-js.org')
    ),
)
```

To retrieve information about a page element, use [Serenity/JS web questions](/api/web/):

| Protractor                                                                                                                             | Serenity/JS                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`element(by.id('...')).getAttribute('class')`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=webdriver.WebElement.prototype.getAttribute) | [`CssClasses.of(pageElement)`](/api/web/class/CssClasses/)                                            | Serenity/JS returns an array of CSS classes to make assertions easier, instead of a single string like plain Protractor |
| [`element(by.id('...')).getAttribute('value')`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=webdriver.WebElement.prototype.getAttribute) | [`Value.of(pageElement)`](/api/web/class/Value/)                                                      | Serenity/JS has a dedicated question for retrieving the `value` attribute of `<input />` elements                       |
| [`element(by.id('...')).getText()`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=webdriver.WebElement.prototype.getText)                  | [`Text.of(pageElement)`](/api/web/class/Text/) and [`Text.ofAll(pageElements)`](/api/web/class/Text/) | Serenity/JS makes it easier to retrieve text content of all elements in a collection                                    |

For example, to navigate to a page and assert on the CSS classes of an element, you could say:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { By, CssClasses, Navigate, PageElement } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, include } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

const startAutomatingButton = () =>
    PageElement.located(By.cssContainingText('.button', 'Start automating'))
        .describedAs('"Start automating" button')

await actorCalled('Amanda').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    Ensure.that(
        CssClasses.of(startAutomatingButton()),
        include('button--primary')
    ),
)
```

### Performing interactions

To interact with a web page or a page element, instruct an [actor](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#actors) to perform
a desired [interaction](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#interactions).
Note that Serenity/JS also consistently models all [assertion](/handbook/design/assertions/), [synchronisation](/handbook/design/waiting-and-synchronisation/)
[logging](/handbook/design/logging/), [debugging](//handbook/design/debugging/), and [control flow](/handbook/design/control-flow/) statements as interactions too.

For example, to navigate to a page, click on a button and perform an assertion, you could say:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { By, Click, Navigate, Page, PageElement } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

const startAutomatingButton = () =>
    PageElement.located(By.cssContainingText('.button', 'Start automating'))
        .describedAs('"Start automating" button')

await actorCalled('Amanda').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    Click.on(startAutomatingButton()),
    Ensure.that(
        Page.current().url().path,
        equals('/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/')
    )
)
```

Note that one of Serenity/JS super-powers is the ability to compose
interactions into [tasks](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#tasks), like `startTutorial()` below,
which makes your code easy to share and reuse:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Task } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Click, Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

// ...

const startTutorial = () =>
    Task.where(`#actor starts the Serenity/JS tutorial`,
        Click.on(startAutomatingButton()),
        Ensure.that(
            Page.current().url().path,
            equals('/handbook/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/')
        )
    )

await actorCalled('Amanda').attemptsTo(
    Navigate.to('https://serenity-js.org'),
    startTutorial(),
)
```

Below table shows how you can replace Protractor-specific API calls with [Serenity/JS web interactions](/api/web/#Index):

| Protractor                        | Serenity/JS                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `element(locator).click()`        | [Click.on(pageElement)](/api/web/class/Click/)                  |
| `element(locator).clear()`        | [Clear.theValueOf(pageElement)](/api/web/class/Clear/)          |
| `element(locator).sendKeys(text)` | [Enter.theValue(text).into(pageElement)](/api/web/class/Enter/) |


### Waiting and synchronisation

To express a [synchronisation statement](/handbook/design/waiting-and-synchronisation/),
use [`Wait.until`](/api/core/class/Wait/)
or [`Ensure.eventually`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure/#eventually).

| Protractor                       | Serenity/JS                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `element(locator).isPresent()`   | [`Wait.until(pageElement, isPresent())`](/api/assertions/function/isPresent/) |
| `element(locator).isEnabled()`   | [`Wait.until(pageElement, isEnabled())`](/api/web/function/isEnabled/)        |
| `element(locator).isSelected()`  | [`Wait.until(pageElement, isSelected())`](/api/web/function/isSelected/)      |
| `element(locator).isDisplayed()` | [`Wait.until(pageElement, isVisible())`](/api/web/function/isVisible/)        |

### Replacing Protractor with WebdriverIO

In many ways, [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) is very similar to Protractor:
- it integrates with the same test runners, such as [Cucumber, Mocha, and Jasmine](https://webdriver.io/docs/frameworks/)
- it works well with [Serenity/JS](https://webdriver.io/docs/frameworks/#using-serenityjs)
- it works with local browsers and remote Selenium Grids
- it supports multi-tab and multi-window test scenarios
- it supports mobile testing
- its [configuration file](https://webdriver.io/docs/configuration) follows a similar structure

Once you've migrated your test scenarios to follow the Screenplay Pattern and there are no Protractor API calls left
in your code, follow WebdriverIO Protractor migration guide to:
- [migrate the configuration file](https://webdriver.io/docs/protractor-migration#first-the-config-file)
- [install the WebdriverIO dependencies](https://webdriver.io/docs/protractor-migration#install-webdriverio-dependencies)

Next, install Serenity/JS WebdriverIO module:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @serenity-js/webdriverio --save-dev
```

Update the `script` section in your `package.json` to use `wdio` instead of `protractor`:

```diff title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "serenity-bdd update",
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
-   "test:execute": "protractor ./protractor.conf.js",
+   "test:execute": "wdio ./wdio.conf.ts",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
  }
}
```

Once your test suite works, remove Protractor and its related Serenity/JS module:

```sh npm2yarn
npm uninstall protractor @serenity-js/protractor --save
```
