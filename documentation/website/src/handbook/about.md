# About this book

The goal of the Serenity/JS Handbook is to help you get started with writing scalable acceptance tests using the Serenity/JS framework.

The book consists of the following parts:
- **Overview**, which provides an overview of the project, its license, support, and contribution models. 
- **Thinking in Serenity/JS**, which provides examples and a step-by-step explanation of the ideas behind Serenity/JS, to help you understand not only the APIs of the framework, but also its spirit. 
- **Design Guide**, which provides an in-depth explanation and more advanced usage examples of the key elements of the Serenity/JS  
- **Integration Guide**, which provides information on integrating Serenity/JS with other test frameworks and tools.

If you'd like to dive straight into the code, visit [Serenity/JS Github](https://github.com/serenity-js) where you can find:
 - [example projects](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/master/examples) demonstrating the usage of the framework,
 - [template repositories](https://github.com/serenity-js) to use as a starting point for your projects.
