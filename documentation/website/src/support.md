## Serenity/JS Mentoring

If you'd like to fast-track your test automation efforts and get the befits of reliable, high-quality, easy-to-maintain automated test suites sooner,
consider opting for individual or team mentoring with the Serenity/JS core team.

The mentoring packages you can purchase via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jan-molak) or [directly](mailto:jan.molak@serenity.io?subject=Serenity/JS Mentoring) will help you:
- get your engineers and traditional (possibly manual) testers up to speed with modern test automation practices and Serenity/JS
- adapt the tests to work in your environment and with our infrastructure
- make your tests more robust and easier to maintain.

The Serenity/JS mentoring packages provide a cost-effective answer to these problems.

Training is delivered by core contributors, including the author of the framework.
