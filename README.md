> 
> We're also in the process migrating all the existing Serenity/JS project templates to make it easier for you to start your journey with the new version of the framework. You can already use:
> - [serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/tree/main)
> - [serenity-js-cucumber-webdriverio-template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-webdriverio-template/tree/main)
> - [serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template/tree/main)
