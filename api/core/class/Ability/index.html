## Giving actors the abilities to interact

Serenity/JS actors are capable of interacting with **any interface** of the system under test,
be it a [web UI](/handbook/web-testing/), a [mobile app](/handbook/mobile-testing/), a [web service](/handbook/api-testing/),
or {@apilink Ability|anything else} that a Node.js program can talk to.
This flexibility is enabled by a mechanism called _**abilities**_
and achieved without introducing any unnecessary dependencies to your code base thanks to the [modular architecture](/handbook/about/architecture) of Serenity/JS.

:::tip Remember
**Actors** have **abilities** that enable them to **perform interactions** and **answer questions**.
:::

From the technical perspective, an **ability** is an [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)
around an interface-specific integration library, such as a web browser driver, an HTTP client, a database client, and so on.
You give an actor an ability, and it&#x27;s the ability&#x27;s responsibility to provide a consistent API around the integration library and deal with any of its quirks.
Abilities **encapsulate integration libraries** and handle their {@apilink Initialisable|configuration and initialisation},
the process of {@apilink Discardable|freeing up any resources} they hold,
as well as managing any state associated with the library.

### Portable interactions with web interfaces

To make your Serenity/JS actors interact with web interfaces,
you call the [`Actor.whoCan`](/api/core/class/Actor#whoCan) method and give them an implementation of the ability to [`BrowseTheWeb`](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb),
specific to your web integration tool of choice.

Note how {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright}, {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO}, and {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithProtractor}
all **extend** the base ability to {@apilink BrowseTheWeb}.

#### Playwright

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from &#x27;@serenity-js/playwright&#x27;   // Serenity/JS integration module
import { chromium } from &#x27;playwright&#x27;

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true })              // integration library

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)                                            // generic actor
  .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser))                   // tool-specific ability
```

#### WebdriverIO

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO } from &#x27;@serenity-js/webdriverio&#x27; // Serenity/JS integration module

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)                                            // generic actor
  .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO.using(browser))                  // tool-specific ability
```

#### Protractor

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithProtractor } from &#x27;@serenity-js/protractor&#x27;   // Serenity/JS integration module
import { protractor } from &#x27;protractor&#x27;                                // integration library

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)                                            // generic actor
  .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithProtractor.using(protractor.browser))        // tool-specific ability
```

### Retrieving an ability

Use {@apilink Ability.as} to retrieve an ability in a custom {@apilink Interaction} or {@apilink Question} implementation.

Here, `Ability` can be the integration library-specific class, for example {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright},
or its library-agnostic parent class, like {@apilink BrowseTheWeb}.

To make your code portable across the various integration libraries, retrieve the ability
using the library-agnostic parent class:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWeb } from &#x27;@serenity-js/web&#x27; // Serenity/JS web module

const actor    = actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)
const ability  = await BrowseTheWeb.as(actor)   // retrieve implementation of BrowseTheWeb
```

As you can already see, providing **encapsulation** and a **cleaner API** around the integration libraries are not the only reasons why you&#x27;d want to use the abilities.

Another reason is that the Serenity/JS implementation of the Screenplay Pattern lets you **completely decouple the actor from the integration libraries**
and make the abilities of the same type **interchangeable**.
For example, [Serenity/JS web modules](/handbook/web-testing/serenity-js-web-modules) offer an abstraction that lets you switch between web integration libraries
as vastly different as Selenium, WebdriverIO, or Playwright without having to change _anything whatsoever_ in your test scenarios.

What this means is that your test code can become [portable and reusable across projects and teams](/handbook/design/portable-test-code),
even if they don&#x27;t use the same low-level integration tools. It also helps you to **avoid vendor lock-in**, as you can wrap any third-party integration library
into an ability and swap it out for another implementation if you need to.

However, Serenity/JS **doesn&#x27;t prevent you** from using the integration libraries directly.
When you need to, you can use a library-specific ability like {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright}
to trade portability for access to library-specific low-level methods:

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright, PlaywrightPage } from &#x27;@serenity-js/playwright&#x27;

const actor          = actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)
const ability        = await BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.as(actor)
const page           = (await ability.currentPage()) as PlaywrightPage;
const playwrightPage = await page.nativePage();
// use any Playwright-specific APIs on playwrightPage
```

:::warning Using integration library-specific APIs reduces portability
While Serenity/JS provides you with escape hatches and ways to access the low-level APIs of your integration libraries,
doing so can reduce the portability of your code. Only do it when you have a good reason to trade portability for low-level access.
:::


## Associating actors with data

One more reason to use abilities is that abilities can also help you to **associate actors with data** they need to perform their activities.
For example, a commonly used ability is one to [`TakeNotes`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes), which allows your actors to start the test scenario
equipped with some data set, or record information about what they see in the test scenario so that they can act upon it later:

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Notepad, TakeNotes } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

interface MyNotes {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  emailAddress: string;
}

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)
  .whoCan(
    TakeNotes.using(Notepad.with&lt;MyNotes&gt;({
      firstName: &#x27;Trevor&#x27;,
      lastName: &#x27;Traveller&#x27;,
      emailAddress: &#x27;Trevor.Traveller@example.org&#x27;,
    }))
  )
```

## Actors with multiple abilities

Of course, an actor can have **any number of abilities** they need to play their role.
For example, it is quite common for an actor to be able to [`BrowseTheWeb`](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb), [`TakeNotes`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes), and [`CallAnApi`](/api/rest/class/CallAnApi):

```typescript
import { actorCalled, Notepad, TakeNotes } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from &#x27;@serenity-js/playwright&#x27;
import { CallAnApi } from &#x27;@serenity-js/rest&#x27;
import { chromium } from &#x27;playwright&#x27;

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true })
const baseURL = &#x27;https://example.org&#x27;

interface MyNotes {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  emailAddress: string;
}

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)
  .whoCan(
    BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser, { baseURL }),
    CallAnApi.at(`${ baseURL }/api`),
    TakeNotes.using(Notepad.with&lt;MyNotes&gt;({
      firstName: &#x27;Trevor&#x27;,
      lastName: &#x27;Traveller&#x27;,
      emailAddress: &#x27;Trevor.Traveller@example.org&#x27;,
    }))
  )
```

## Writing custom abilities

If your system under test provides a type of interface that Serenity/JS doesn&#x27;t support yet,
you might want to implement a custom {@apilink Ability}, as well as {@apilink Interaction|interactions}
and {@apilink Question|questions} to interact with it.

The best way to start with that is for you to review the examples in the {@apilink Ability|Screenplay Pattern API docs},
as well as the [Serenity/JS code base on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/packages).
Also note that all the [Serenity/JS modules](/handbook/about/architecture)
have their automated tests written in such a way to not only provide an **extremely high test coverage** for the framework itself,
but to be **accessible** and act as a **reference implementation for you** to create your own integrations.

If you believe that the custom integration you&#x27;ve developed could benefit the wider Serenity/JS community,
please consider open-sourcing it yourself, or [contributing it](/contributing) to the main framework.

### Defining a custom ability to `MakePhoneCalls`

```ts
import { Ability, actorCalled, Interaction } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

class MakePhoneCalls extends Ability {

  // A static method is typically used to inject a client of a given interface
  // and instantiate the ability, for example:
  //   actorCalled(&#x27;Phil&#x27;).whoCan(MakePhoneCalls.using(phone))
  static using(phone: Phone) {
    return new MakePhoneCalls(phone);
  }

  // Abilities can hold state, for example: the client of a given interface,
  // additional configuration, or the result of the last interaction with a given interface.
  protected constructor(private readonly phone: Phone) {
  }

  // Abilities expose methods that enable Interactions to call the system under test,
  // and Questions to retrieve information about its state.
  dial(phoneNumber: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Defining a custom interaction using the custom ability

```ts
import { Answerable, Interaction, the } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

// A custom interaction using the actor&#x27;s ability:
const Call = (phoneNumber: Answerable&lt;string&gt;) =&gt;
  Interaction.where(the`#actor calls ${ phoneNumber }`, async actor =&gt; {
    await MakePhoneCalls.as(actor).dial(phoneNumber)
  })
```

### Using the custom ability and interaction in a test scenario

```ts
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

await actorCalled(&#x27;Connie&#x27;)
  .whoCan(MakePhoneCalls.using(phone))
  .attemptsTo(
    Call(phoneNumber)
  )
```

## Using auto-initialisable and auto-discardable abilities

Abilities that rely on resources that need to be initialised before they can be used,
or discarded before the actor is dismissed can implement the {@apilink Initialisable}
or {@apilink Discardable} interfaces, respectively.

### Defining a custom ability to `QueryPostgresDB`

```ts
import {
  Ability, actorCalled, Discardable, Initialisable, Question, UsesAbilities,
} from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

// Some low-level interface-specific client we want the Actor to use,
// for example a PostgreSQL database client:
const { Client } = require(&#x27;pg&#x27;);

// A custom Ability to give an Actor access to the low-level client:
class QueryPostgresDB
  extends Ability
  implements Initialisable, Discardable
{
  constructor(private readonly client) {
  }

  // Invoked by Serenity/JS upon the first invocation of `actor.attemptsTo`
  initialise(): Promise&lt;void&gt; | void {
    return this.client.connect();
  }

  // Used to ensure that the Ability is not initialised more than once
  isInitialised(): boolean {
    return this.client._connected;
  }

  // Discards any resources the Ability uses when the Actor is dismissed,
  // so when the Stage receives a SceneFinishes event for scenario-scoped actor,
  // or TestRunFinishes for cross-scenario-scoped actors
  discard(): Promise&lt;void&gt; | void {
    return this.client.end();
  }

  // Any custom integration APIs the Ability, should make available to the Actor.
  // Here, we want the ability to enable the actor to query the database.
  query(query: string) {
    return this.client.query(query);
  }

  // ... other custom integration APIs
}
```

### Defining a custom question using the custom ability

```ts
// A custom Question to allow the Actor query the database
const CurrentDBUser = () =&gt;
  Question.about(&#x27;current db user&#x27;, actor =&gt;
    QueryPostgresDB.as(actor)
      .query(&#x27;SELECT current_user&#x27;)
      .then(result =&gt; result.rows[0].current_user)
  );
```

### Using the custom ability and question in a test scenario

```ts
// Example test scenario where the Actor uses the Ability to QueryPostgresDB
// to assert on the username the connection has been established with

import { describe, it } from &#x27;mocha&#x27;
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { Ensure, equals } from &#x27;@serenity-js/assertions&#x27;

describe(&#x27;Serenity/JS&#x27;, () =&gt; {
  it(&#x27;can initialise and discard abilities automatically&#x27;, () =&gt;
    actorCalled(&#x27;Debbie&#x27;)
      .whoCan(new QueryPostgresDB(new Client()))
      .attemptsTo(
        Ensure.that(CurrentDBUser(), equals(&#x27;jan&#x27;))
      ))
})
```

To make your Serenity/JS actors interact with web interfaces,
you call the [`Actor.whoCan`](/api/core/class/Actor#whoCan) method and give them an implementation of the ability to [`BrowseTheWeb`](/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb),
specific to your web integration tool of choice.

Note how {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright}, {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO}, and {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithProtractor}
all **extend** the base ability to {@apilink BrowseTheWeb}.

#### Playwright

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from &#x27;@serenity-js/playwright&#x27;   // Serenity/JS integration module
import { chromium } from &#x27;playwright&#x27;

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true })              // integration library

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)                                            // generic actor
  .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser))                   // tool-specific ability
```

#### WebdriverIO

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO } from &#x27;@serenity-js/webdriverio&#x27; // Serenity/JS integration module

await actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)                                            // generic actor
  .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO.using(browser))                  // tool-specific ability
```

#### Protractor

```typescript
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { BrowseTheWebWithProtractor } from &#x27;@serenity-js/protractor&#x27;   // Serenity/JS integration module
import { protractor } from &#x27;protractor&#x27;                                // integration library

const actor    = actorCalled(&#x27;Trevor&#x27;)
const ability  = await BrowseTheWeb.as(actor)   // retrieve implementation of BrowseTheWeb
```

As you can already see, providing **encapsulation** and a **cleaner API** around the integration libraries are not the only reasons why you&#x27;d want to use the abilities.

If your system under test provides a type of interface that Serenity/JS doesn&#x27;t support yet,
you might want to implement a custom {@apilink Ability}, as well as {@apilink Interaction|interactions}
and {@apilink Question|questions} to interact with it.

The best way to start with that is for you to review the examples in the {@apilink Ability|Screenplay Pattern API docs},
as well as the [Serenity/JS code base on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/packages).
Also note that all the [Serenity/JS modules](/handbook/about/architecture)
have their automated tests written in such a way to not only provide an **extremely high test coverage** for the framework itself,
but to be **accessible** and act as a **reference implementation for you** to create your own integrations.

If you believe that the custom integration you&#x27;ve developed could benefit the wider Serenity/JS community,
please consider open-sourcing it yourself, or [contributing it](/contributing) to the main framework.

### Defining a custom ability to `MakePhoneCalls`

```ts
import { Ability, actorCalled, Interaction } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

class MakePhoneCalls extends Ability {

  // A static method is typically used to inject a client of a given interface
  // and instantiate the ability, for example:
  //   actorCalled(&#x27;Phil&#x27;).whoCan(MakePhoneCalls.using(phone))
  static using(phone: Phone) {
    return new MakePhoneCalls(phone);
  }

  // Abilities can hold state, for example: the client of a given interface,
  // additional configuration, or the result of the last interaction with a given interface.
  protected constructor(private readonly phone: Phone) {
  }

  // Abilities expose methods that enable Interactions to call the system under test,
  // and Questions to retrieve information about its state.
  dial(phoneNumber: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Defining a custom interaction using the custom ability

```ts
import { Answerable, Interaction, the } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

// A custom interaction using the actor&#x27;s ability:
const Call = (phoneNumber: Answerable&lt;string&gt;) =&gt;
  Interaction.where(the`#actor calls ${ phoneNumber }`, async actor =&gt; {
    await MakePhoneCalls.as(actor).dial(phoneNumber)
  })
```

### Using the custom ability and interaction in a test scenario

```ts
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

await actorCalled(&#x27;Connie&#x27;)
  .whoCan(MakePhoneCalls.using(phone))
  .attemptsTo(
    Call(phoneNumber)
  )
```

## Using auto-initialisable and auto-discardable abilities

Abilities that rely on resources that need to be initialised before they can be used,
or discarded before the actor is dismissed can implement the {@apilink Initialisable}
or {@apilink Discardable} interfaces, respectively.

### Defining a custom ability to `QueryPostgresDB`

```ts
import {
  Ability, actorCalled, Discardable, Initialisable, Question, UsesAbilities,
} from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

// Some low-level interface-specific client we want the Actor to use,
// for example a PostgreSQL database client:
const { Client } = require(&#x27;pg&#x27;);

// A custom Ability to give an Actor access to the low-level client:
class QueryPostgresDB
  extends Ability
  implements Initialisable, Discardable
{
  constructor(private readonly client) {
  }

  // Invoked by Serenity/JS upon the first invocation of `actor.attemptsTo`
  initialise(): Promise&lt;void&gt; | void {
    return this.client.connect();
  }

  // Used to ensure that the Ability is not initialised more than once
  isInitialised(): boolean {
    return this.client._connected;
  }

  // Discards any resources the Ability uses when the Actor is dismissed,
  // so when the Stage receives a SceneFinishes event for scenario-scoped actor,
  // or TestRunFinishes for cross-scenario-scoped actors
  discard(): Promise&lt;void&gt; | void {
    return this.client.end();
  }

  // Any custom integration APIs the Ability, should make available to the Actor.
  // Here, we want the ability to enable the actor to query the database.
  query(query: string) {
    return this.client.query(query);
  }

  // ... other custom integration APIs
}
```

### Defining a custom question using the custom ability

```ts
// A custom Question to allow the Actor query the database
const CurrentDBUser = () =&gt;
  Question.about(&#x27;current db user&#x27;, actor =&gt;
    QueryPostgresDB.as(actor)
      .query(&#x27;SELECT current_user&#x27;)
      .then(result =&gt; result.rows[0].current_user)
  );
```

### Using the custom ability and question in a test scenario

```ts
// Example test scenario where the Actor uses the Ability to QueryPostgresDB
// to assert on the username the connection has been established with

import { describe, it } from &#x27;mocha&#x27;
import { actorCalled } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { Ensure, equals } from &#x27;@serenity-js/assertions&#x27;

describe(&#x27;Serenity/JS&#x27;, () =&gt; {
  it(&#x27;can initialise and discard abilities automatically&#x27;, () =&gt;
    actorCalled(&#x27;Debbie&#x27;)
      .whoCan(new QueryPostgresDB(new Client()))
      .attemptsTo(
        Ensure.that(CurrentDBUser(), equals(&#x27;jan&#x27;))
      ))
})
```

<h2>Giving actors the abilities to interact</h2><p>Serenity/JS actors are capable of interacting with <strong>any interface</strong> of the system under test,
be it a <a href="/handbook/web-testing/">web UI</a>, a <a href="/handbook/mobile-testing/">mobile app</a>, a <a href="/handbook/api-testing/">web service</a>,
or <a href="/api/core/class/Ability/">anything else</a> that a Node.js program can talk to.
This flexibility is enabled by a mechanism called <em><strong>abilities</strong></em>
and achieved without introducing any unnecessary dependencies to your code base thanks to the <a href="/handbook/about/architecture/">modular architecture</a> of Serenity/JS.</p>

<p>From the technical perspective, an <strong>ability</strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapter</a>
around an interface-specific integration library, such as a web browser driver, an HTTP client, a database client, and so on.
You give an actor an ability, and it’s the ability’s responsibility to provide a consistent API around the integration library and deal with any of its quirks.
Abilities <strong>encapsulate integration libraries</strong> and handle their <a href="/api/core/interface/Initialisable/">configuration and initialisation</a>,
the process of <a href="/api/core/interface/Discardable/">freeing up any resources</a> they hold,
as well as managing any state associated with the library.</p>

<h3>Portable interactions with web interfaces</h3><p>To make your Serenity/JS actors interact with web interfaces,
you call the <a href="/api/core/class/Actor/#whoCan"><code>Actor.whoCan</code></a> method and give them an implementation of the ability to <a href="/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/"><code>BrowseTheWeb</code></a>,
specific to your web integration tool of choice.</p>

<p>Note how <a href="/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/">BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright</a>, <a href="/api/webdriverio/class/BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO/">BrowseTheWebWithWebdriverIO</a>, and <a href="/api/protractor/class/BrowseTheWebWithProtractor/">BrowseTheWebWithProtractor</a>
all <strong>extend</strong> the base ability to <a href="/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/">BrowseTheWeb</a>.</p>

<h3>Retrieving an ability</h3><p>Use <a href="/api/core/class/Ability/#as">Ability.as</a> to retrieve an ability in a custom <a href="/api/core/class/Interaction/">Interaction</a> or <a href="/api/core/class/Question/">Question</a> implementation.</p>

<p>Here, <code>Ability</code> can be the integration library-specific class, for example <a href="/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/">BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright</a>,
or its library-agnostic parent class, like <a href="/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/">BrowseTheWeb</a>.</p>

<p>To make your code portable across the various integration libraries, retrieve the ability
using the library-agnostic parent class:</p>

<p>As you can already see, providing <strong>encapsulation</strong> and a <strong>cleaner API</strong> around the integration libraries are not the only reasons why you’d want to use the abilities.</p>

<p>Another reason is that the Serenity/JS implementation of the Screenplay Pattern lets you <strong>completely decouple the actor from the integration libraries</strong>
and make the abilities of the same type <strong>interchangeable</strong>.
For example, <a href="/handbook/web-testing/serenity-js-web-modules/">Serenity/JS web modules</a> offer an abstraction that lets you switch between web integration libraries
as vastly different as Selenium, WebdriverIO, or Playwright without having to change <em>anything whatsoever</em> in your test scenarios.</p>

<p>What this means is that your test code can become <a href="/handbook/design/portable-test-code/">portable and reusable across projects and teams</a>,
even if they don’t use the same low-level integration tools. It also helps you to <strong>avoid vendor lock-in</strong>, as you can wrap any third-party integration library
into an ability and swap it out for another implementation if you need to.</p>

<p>However, Serenity/JS <strong>doesn’t prevent you</strong> from using the integration libraries directly.
When you need to, you can use a library-specific ability like <a href="/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/">BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright</a>
to trade portability for access to library-specific low-level methods:</p>

equipped with some data set, or record information about what they see in the test scenario so that they can act upon it later:</p>

<h2>Actors with multiple abilities</h2><p>Of course, an actor can have <strong>any number of abilities</strong> they need to play their role.
For example, it is quite common for an actor to be able to <a href="/api/web/class/BrowseTheWeb/"><code>BrowseTheWeb</code></a>, <a href="/api/core/class/TakeNotes/"><code>TakeNotes</code></a>, and <a href="/api/rest/class/CallAnApi/"><code>CallAnApi</code></a>:</p>

<h2>Writing custom abilities</h2><p>If your system under test provides a type of interface that Serenity/JS doesn’t support yet,
you might want to implement a custom <a href="/api/core/class/Ability/">Ability</a>, as well as <a href="/api/core/class/Interaction/">interactions</a>
and <a href="/api/core/class/Question/">questions</a> to interact with it.</p>

<p>The best way to start with that is for you to review the examples in the <a href="/api/core/class/Ability/">Screenplay Pattern API docs</a>,
as well as the <a href="https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serenity/JS code base on GitHub</a>.
Also note that all the <a href="/handbook/about/architecture/">Serenity/JS modules</a>
have their automated tests written in such a way to not only provide an <strong>extremely high test coverage</strong> for the framework itself,
but to be <strong>accessible</strong> and act as a <strong>reference implementation for you</strong> to create your own integrations.</p>

<p>If you believe that the custom integration you’ve developed could benefit the wider Serenity/JS community,
please consider open-sourcing it yourself, or <a href="/contributing/">contributing it</a> to the main framework.</p>
