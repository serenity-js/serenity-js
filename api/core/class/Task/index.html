and help you capture meaningful steps of an {@apilink Actor|actor} workflow
in your domain.

Typically, tasks correspond to higher-level, business domain-specific activities
like to `BookAPlaneTicket`, `PlaceATrade`, `TransferFunds`, and so on.
However, higher-level tasks can and should be composed of lower-level tasks.
For example, a task to `SignUp` could be composed of tasks to `ProvideUsername` and `ProvidePassword`.

The lowest-level tasks in your abstraction hierarchy should be composed of {@apilink Interaction|interactions}.
For example, a low-level task to `ProvideUsername` could be composed of an interaction to {@apilink Enter} the value
into a form field and {@apilink Press} the {@apilink Key.Enter}.

Tasks are the core building block of the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern),
along with {@apilink Actor|Actors}, {@apilink Ability|Abilities}, {@apilink Interaction|Interactions}, and {@apilink Question|Questions}.

- {@apilink Interaction|Interactions}

## Defining a task

```ts
import { Answerable, Task, d } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { By, Click, Enter, PageElement, Press, Key } from &#x27;@serenity-js/web&#x27;

const SignIn = (username: Answerable&lt;string&gt;, password: Answerable&lt;string&gt;) =&gt;
  Task.where(d`#actor signs is as ${ username }`,
    Enter.theValue(username).into(PageElement.located(By.id(&#x27;username&#x27;))),
    Enter.theValue(password).into(PageElement.located(By.id(&#x27;password&#x27;))),
    Press.the(Key.Enter),
  );
```

## Defining a not implemented task

Note that calling {@apilink Task.where} method without providing the sequence of {@apilink Activity|activities}
produces a Task that&#x27;s marked as &quot;pending&quot; in the test report.

This feature is useful when you want to quickly write down a task that will be needed in the scenario,
but you&#x27;re not yet sure what activities it will involve.

```ts
import { Task } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

const SignUp = () =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor signs up for a newsletter`) // no activities provided
                                                   // =&gt; task marked as pending
```

## Composing activities into tasks

The purpose of **tasks** is to help you capture domain vocabulary by **associating domain meaning** with a **sequence of activities**.
From the implementation perspective, tasks help you give a **meaningful description** to such sequence
and provide a way to **easily reuse activities across your code base**.

:::tip Remember
**Tasks** associate **domain meaning** with a sequence of **lower-level activities** and provide a mechanism for **code reuse**.
:::

For example, a task to _find a flight connection from London to New York_ could be modelled as a sequence of the following lower-level activities:
- specify origin city of &quot;London&quot;
- specify destination city of &quot;New York&quot;

The easiest way to implement such task, and any custom Serenity/JS task for this matter, is to use the {@apilink Task.where} method to compose the lower-level activities:

```typescript
import { Task } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;

const findFlight = (originCity: string, destinationCity: string) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actors finds a flight from ${ originCity } to ${ destinationCity }`,   // task goal
        specifyOriginCity(originCity),                                                  // activities
        specifyDestinationCity(originCity),
    )
```

Furthermore, if the actor was interacting with a web UI, a task to _specify origin city_ could again be composed of other activities:
- click on the `origin airport` widget
- enter city name of `London`
- pick the first suggested airport from the list

Conversely, a task to _specify destination city_ could be composed of:
- click on the `destination airport` widget
- enter city name of `New York`
- pick the first suggested airport from the list

Conveniently, [Serenity/JS modules](/handbook/about/architecture) provide low-level activities that
allow actors to interact with the various interfaces of the system under test.
For example, [Serenity/JS Web module](/api/web) ships with activities such as {@apilink Click} or {@apilink Enter},
which we can incorporate into our task definitions just like any other activities:

```typescript
import { Task } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { Click, Enter, Key, Press } from &#x27;@serenity-js/web&#x27;

import { FlightFinder } from &#x27;./ui/flight-finder&#x27;

const specifyOriginCity = (originCity: string) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor specifies origin city of ${ originCity }`,
        Click.on(FlightFinder.originAirport),
        Enter.theValue(originCity).into(FlightFinder.originAirport),
        Press.the(Key.ArrowDown, Key.Enter).into(FlightFinder.originAirport),
    )

const specifyDestinationCity = (destinationCity: string) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor specifies destination city of ${ destinationCity }`,
        Click.on(FlightFinder.destinationAirport),
        Enter.theValue(destinationCity).into(FlightFinder.destinationAirport),
        Press.the(Key.ArrowDown, Key.Enter).into(FlightFinder.destinationAirport),
    )
```

As you can already see, tasks to _specify origin city_ and _specify destination city_ are almost identical,
save for the name of the widget and the text value the actor is supposed to enter.
Serenity/JS **task-based code reuse model** means that we can clean up such duplicated implementation
by **extracting a parameterised task**, in this case called `specifyCity`:

```typescript
import { Task } from &#x27;@serenity-js/core&#x27;
import { Click, Enter, Key, PageElement, Press } from &#x27;@serenity-js/web&#x27;

import { FlightFinder } from &#x27;./ui/flight-finder&#x27;

const specifyOriginCity = (originCity: string) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor specifies origin city of ${ originCity }`,
        specifyCity(originCity, FlightFinder.originAirport)
    )

const specifyDestinationCity = (destinationCity: string) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor specifies destination city of ${ destinationCity }`,
        specifyCity(destinationCity, FlightFinder.destinationAirport),
    )

const specifyCity = (cityName: string, widget: PageElement) =&gt;
    Task.where(`#actor specifies city of ${ cityName } in ${ widget }`,
        Click.on(widget),
        Enter.theValue(cityName).into(widget),
        Press.the(Key.ArrowDown, Key.Enter).into(widget),
    )
```

As you work with Serenity/JS, you&#x27;ll notice that the ideas of **functional decomposition**, so thinking of tasks as sequences of lower-level activities,
as well as **functional composition**, so implementing reusable activities and composing them into higher-level tasks,
are at the heart of the Screenplay Pattern. You&#x27;ll also notice that the entire Serenity/JS framework does it best to help your team follow this approach.

:::info The power of the Serenity/JS task-based code reuse model
What makes the Serenity/JS task-based code reuse model so **powerful at scale** is the observation that:
- for most software systems, a vast number of **diverse test scenarios** can be composed of a relatively **small number of high-level activities**
- all **high-level activities** can be composed of a relatively **small number of lower-level activities**
- in a reasonably consistently-designed software system, most lower-level activities tend to be similar and rather consistent across the various aspects of a given interface.
In particular, **there are only so many ways** one can interact with a UI button or send an HTTP request to a web service.

What this means in practice is that by investing your time in properly designing **relatively few reusable tasks**
to test your system, you give your team a **significant productivity boost** and **leverage** when producing high-level test scenarios.

On top of that, this design approach results not only in **simpler test scenarios** that reduce
the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) on the reader as they require them to process
the scenario only one level of abstraction at the time.
It also allows for the test to **take shortcuts** in well-defined points of the workflow - use a REST API request to create
a test user account instead of going through the registration form.

and help you capture meaningful steps of an <a href="/api/core/class/Actor/">actor</a> workflow
in your domain.</p>

<p>Typically, tasks correspond to higher-level, business domain-specific activities
like to <code>BookAPlaneTicket</code>, <code>PlaceATrade</code>, <code>TransferFunds</code>, and so on.
However, higher-level tasks can and should be composed of lower-level tasks.
For example, a task to <code>SignUp</code> could be composed of tasks to <code>ProvideUsername</code> and <code>ProvidePassword</code>.</p>

<p>The lowest-level tasks in your abstraction hierarchy should be composed of <a href="/api/core/class/Interaction/">interactions</a>.
For example, a low-level task to <code>ProvideUsername</code> could be composed of an interaction to <a href="/api/web/class/Enter/">Enter</a> the value
into a form field and <a href="/api/web/class/Press/">Press</a> the <a href="/api/web/class/Key/#Enter">Key.Enter</a>.</p>

<p>Tasks are the core building block of the <a href="/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/">Screenplay Pattern</a>,
along with <a href="/api/core/class/Actor/">Actors</a>, <a href="/api/core/class/Ability/">Abilities</a>, <a href="/api/core/class/Interaction/">Interactions</a>, and <a href="/api/core/class/Question/">Questions</a>.</p>

<h2>Defining a not implemented task</h2><p>Note that calling <a href="/api/core/class/Task/#where">Task.where</a> method without providing the sequence of <a href="/api/core/class/Activity/">activities</a>
produces a Task that’s marked as “pending” in the test report.</p>

<p>This feature is useful when you want to quickly write down a task that will be needed in the scenario,
but you’re not yet sure what activities it will involve.</p>

<h2>Composing activities into tasks</h2><p>The purpose of <strong>tasks</strong> is to help you capture domain vocabulary by <strong>associating domain meaning</strong> with a <strong>sequence of activities</strong>.
From the implementation perspective, tasks help you give a <strong>meaningful description</strong> to such sequence
and provide a way to <strong>easily reuse activities across your code base</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a task to <em>find a flight connection from London to New York</em> could be modelled as a sequence of the following lower-level activities:</p><ul><li>specify origin city of “London”</li><li>specify destination city of “New York”</li></ul>

<p>The easiest way to implement such task, and any custom Serenity/JS task for this matter, is to use the <a href="/api/core/class/Task/#where">Task.where</a> method to compose the lower-level activities:</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the actor was interacting with a web UI, a task to <em>specify origin city</em> could again be composed of other activities:</p><ul><li>click on the <code>origin airport</code> widget</li><li>enter city name of <code>London</code></li><li>pick the first suggested airport from the list</li></ul>

<p>Conversely, a task to <em>specify destination city</em> could be composed of:</p><ul><li>click on the <code>destination airport</code> widget</li><li>enter city name of <code>New York</code></li><li>pick the first suggested airport from the list</li></ul>

<p>Conveniently, <a href="/handbook/about/architecture/">Serenity/JS modules</a> provide low-level activities that
allow actors to interact with the various interfaces of the system under test.
For example, <a href="/api/web/">Serenity/JS Web module</a> ships with activities such as <a href="/api/web/class/Click/">Click</a> or <a href="/api/web/class/Enter/">Enter</a>,
which we can incorporate into our task definitions just like any other activities:</p>

<p>As you can already see, tasks to <em>specify origin city</em> and <em>specify destination city</em> are almost identical,
save for the name of the widget and the text value the actor is supposed to enter.
Serenity/JS <strong>task-based code reuse model</strong> means that we can clean up such duplicated implementation
by <strong>extracting a parameterised task</strong>, in this case called <code>specifyCity</code>:</p>

<p>As you work with Serenity/JS, you’ll notice that the ideas of <strong>functional decomposition</strong>, so thinking of tasks as sequences of lower-level activities,
as well as <strong>functional composition</strong>, so implementing reusable activities and composing them into higher-level tasks,
are at the heart of the Screenplay Pattern. You’ll also notice that the entire Serenity/JS framework does it best to help your team follow this approach.</p>

In particular, <strong>there are only so many ways</strong> one can interact with a UI button or send an HTTP request to a web service.</li></ul>

<p>What this means in practice is that by investing your time in properly designing <strong>relatively few reusable tasks</strong>
to test your system, you give your team a <strong>significant productivity boost</strong> and <strong>leverage</strong> when producing high-level test scenarios.</p>

<p>On top of that, this design approach results not only in <strong>simpler test scenarios</strong> that reduce
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cognitive load</a> on the reader as they require them to process
the scenario only one level of abstraction at the time.
It also allows for the test to <strong>take shortcuts</strong> in well-defined points of the workflow - use a REST API request to create
a test user account instead of going through the registration form.</p></div></div></div></div></div><section class="tsd-panel"><h3 class="tsd-panel-header">Hierarchy</h3><div
